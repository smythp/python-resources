## Python resources

### [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)

A quick introduction to Python that doesn't do a lot of hand-holding. 

### [Python for Kids](http://iss.schoolwires.com/cms/lib4/NC01000579/Centricity/Domain/408/Python%20for%20Kids%20-%20A%20Playful%20Introduction%20to%20Programming.pdf)

An introduction to Python with a gentler learning curve. 

### [CodeAcademy: Python](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python)

An interactive tutorial for learning the basics of Python. (I recommend trying the books above first, as learning to use an IDE such as IDLE is an important part of the learning curve.)

### [Intro to Python slideshow](https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=BE621B7576D48090&resid=BE621B7576D48090%21107&authkey=ALsfz0QwejBNUZ8&em=2)

A slideshow that covers the basic concepts introduced in the Intro Python workshop

### [Straightforward Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZOWDJyMq2Y)

A video series covering many of the same concepts demonstrated in the workshop. Still under development.
